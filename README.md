# TAGS IN HTML FILE
```<head>``` - container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the tag and the tag.
```<meta>``` - provides metadata about the HTML document.
```<script>``` - is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).The ```<script>``` element either contains scripting statements,
 or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.
```<link>``` - defines a link between a document and an external resource. The ```<link>``` tag is used to
 link to external style sheets.
```<style>``` - tag is used to define style information for an HTML document.
 Inside the ```<style>``` element you specify how HTML elements should render in a browser. 
 Each HTML document can contain multiple ```<style>``` tags.
```<body>``` - tag defines the document's body. The ```<body>``` element contains all the contents of an HTML document,
 such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.

 The ```<div>``` element is often used as a container for other HTML elements to style them with CSS.
